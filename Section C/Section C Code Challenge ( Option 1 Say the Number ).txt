Section C Code Challenge ( Option 1 Say the Number )

Follow these instructions to construct, examine, and execute the solution:

1: Initiate a terminal or command prompt.
2: Go to the folder where the script file is located.
3: Type in the command python3 say_number.py (or python say_number.py on Windows) to execute the script.
4: The test results and any errors or failures should be shown in the output.

The space complexity of this solution is O(1), which implies that the lists of words and variables
utilized in the algorithm use a fixed amount of memory, regardless of the input size. However, 
the time complexity is O(log_1000 n), where n is the input number, since the algorithm performs a 
constant amount of work for each group of three digits in the number. This indicates that the
execution time of the algorithm grows logarithmically with the size of the input number.
